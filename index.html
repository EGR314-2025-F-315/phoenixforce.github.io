            Wildfires are becoming more common and more severe, and one of the
            biggest challenges for responders is catching early hot spots before
            they grow into large fires. Many of these early warning signs happen
            in remote areas where people aren’t always able to check in person.
            Our project focuses on solving this problem by creating TerraGuard,
            an autonomous rover that can patrol an area and collect real-time
            environmental data that may point to potential wildfire activity.
            The main purpose of the system is to help detect changes in
            temperature, smoke, air quality, and other conditions so responders
            can react faster and more safely. The target users for this system
            are firefighters, fire-watch teams, and emergency response groups
            who need reliable information from the field without having to
            physically be in dangerous areas. We also considered secondary users
            like researchers and community partners who could use the data for
            studying fire behavior or improving prevention strategies. These
            users need technology that is easy to understand, simple to operate,
            and durable enough for outdoor environments. The scope of our
            project includes designing and prototyping a complete embedded
            system using sensors, a microcontroller, wireless communication, and
            a mobile rover platform. TerraGuard uses HTTPS to send and receive
            data to and from the base station, where alerts can be viewed in
            real time. If the rover detects something past a safe threshold, it
            triggers LEDs and a speaker to warn responders. Our prototype
            includes multiple environmental sensors, a GPS module, and a camera
            mounted on a mobile rover. The system reads data, checks it against
            preset safety limits, and communicates the information through a
            mesh network. Each team member received $60 toward the project,
            giving us a total budget of $360 to build and test the rover.

          </div>
          <p class="text-ink/80">
            At the start of the project, our team brainstormed over a hundred
            different ideas. We eventually narrowed them down to a top fifteen
            list that included things like a thermal-camera drone, smoke
            sensors, LoRa mesh communication, rugged weather stations,
            swappable-battery systems, and even a hybrid firefighting drone.
            While going through these ideas, we noticed that many of them
            pointed toward the same need, which was early wildfire detection
            with good mobility and reliable communication. Instead of choosing a
            fully stationary weather station or going with an expensive UAV
            platform, our team decided to combine the idea of a mobile sensing
            unit with a simple HMI. We felt this gave us a unique direction
            while still being realistic for our skill level and budget. We also
            chose a rover instead of a drone because drones are much more
            difficult to operate, cost more to maintain, and have very short
            battery life. A rover can carry more sensors, run longer, and avoid
            flight restrictions, which made it the better choice for us.
            Instructor feedback also played a big role in shaping our concept.
            We were asked to put our concept generation directly on the website
            instead of only submitting a document. The suggestion to use
            pop-ups or tabs pushed us to make the site more interactive. We were
            also told to cite any AI-generated images and to add callouts to our
            product sketch so viewers could easily tell what each subsystem was.
            This helped us clean up our presentation and make our design
            clearer. The biggest pivot we made was shifting from drone-based
            sensing to a ground-based rover that collects temperature,
            heat-pattern, air-quality, humidity, and pressure data. Once we
            decided on this approach, we focused on adding mesh-network
            communication and a separate screen module for displaying alerts.
            This final concept fit the course requirements, stayed within our
            budget, and gave us something original that was not copied from
            online projects.

            </h2>
          </div>
          <p class="text-ink/80">
            A. Final System Architecture Overview Our final system is made up of
            two main parts that work together: the Rover Unit and the Commander
            Screen Unit. The Rover Unit uses an ESP32-CAM as the main
            controller, and it is responsible for collecting all sensor data and
            streaming live video. It reads information from the BME688 for
            temperature and humidity, the MQ-2 sensor for smoke and flammable
            gases, the ultrasonic sensor for distance measurements, the GPS
            module for coordinates, and the MPU6050 for tilt and terrain
            feedback. The L298N motor driver is also connected to the rover so
            it can handle forward, reverse, and turning commands. All of these
            components run through the ESP32-CAM, which processes the data and
            manages how the rover responds. A key part of how the system works
            is that the Rover ESP32 creates its own Wi-Fi Access Point. This
            allows the system to work even in remote areas because it does not
            depend on outside Wi-Fi or internet. The Commander Screen Unit,
            which uses a CrowPanel ESP32-S3 display, connects directly to this
            Access Point. After it connects, the screen starts polling the rover
            for updated sensor readings while also displaying the MJPEG video
            stream. The user interface was built in LVGL, and it shows the main
            metrics including gas readings, GPS position, humidity and
            temperature, and ultrasonic distance. The screen also plays audio
            alerts and changes LED effects when there is a warning such as high
            gas levels, an obstacle too close to the rover, or poor camera
            visibility. Movement commands go back to the rover through simple
            HTTP requests sent from the screen. When the user presses a button
            on the interface, the Commander sends a command to the rover using
            the same Access Point connection. The rover then activates the
            correct motor pins. We also added safety checks so the rover can
            cancel movement on its own if something dangerous is detected. For
            example, if the ultrasonic sensor detects an obstacle in the stop
            zone, the rover refuses to move and notifies the screen. Overall,
            the two units form a closed system where the rover continuously
            sends data and video to the screen while the screen sends control
            commands back. Because everything runs through the rover’s Access
            Point, the system stays self-contained and reliable in the field.
            This made it possible for us to create a real-time monitoring rover
            that supports environmental sensing, obstacle detection, and user
            control in a simple and effective way.

              Block Diagram Rationale
            </h2>
          </div>
          <p class="text-ink/80">
            We structured our block diagram in a way that separates each major
            subsystem so we could clearly understand how the rover, power
            system, and screen module all connect. At the time we created it, we
            already had our main idea but not the full execution plan, so the
            goal was to map out how every part would communicate and share
            power. Breaking the system into three main sections helped us
            organize our thinking: the rover electronics, the power subsystem,
            and the screen/HMI module. This made it easier for the team to see
            which parts depended on each other and which components needed
            dedicated pins, power rails, or communication lines. This structure
            also lines up with the product requirements for EGR 314. We needed
            at least one complex actuator subsystem, so the L298 motor driver
            and motors satisfy that requirement. We also needed serial sensors
            and analog sensing, which we met through the BME688 (I²C) and the
            gas sensors. The Rover ESP32 and the Screen ESP32 communicate over
            UART and mesh networking, which meets the microcontroller
            communication requirements. Keeping the block diagram simple and
            modular allowed us to plan for our PCB design, pin mapping, voltage
            regulation, and the final 100 × 100 mm board limit. Responsibilities
            were divided based on each person’s subsystem in the diagram. Erjan
            took the GPS and motor driver, Amanda and Danitza handled the BME688
            and gas sensor branches, Emonie handled the external antennas, James
            handled the entire power subsystem, and Vinny handled the screen
            module and RX/TX communication. The block diagram layout made it
            clear who owned what and how all the pieces would come together. We
            also improved the diagram based on instructor feedback. We were
            asked to add the minimum and maximum voltages for each subsystem so
            we could decide whether a 12V, 9V, or 7V battery would be needed,
            and this pushed us to look deeper into voltage regulation and power
            routing. We were also told to upload the updated diagram to our
            website, which helped us clean up the labels and present the diagram
            in a clearer and more readable way.

C. For each power rail above, select a specific voltage regulator using the same process as for major component selection. Confirm that the Total Remaining Current Available on each rail above is not negative.


D. Select a specific external power source (wall supply or battery) for your system, and confirm that it can supply all of the regulators for all of the power rails simultaneously. If you need multiple power sources, list each separately below and indicate which regulators will be connected to each supply. Confirm that the Total Remaining Current Available on each power source below is not negative.

Notes





External Supply Voltage should be determined by the dropout voltage for highest-voltage regulator (e.g., +14V for a +12V regulator).
If you have multiple units in your design (e.g., a base unit and remote unit) then you need a separate power budget for each unit</pre>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-ink/80 space-y-1">
              <li>
                One toolchain per PCB saves sanity; mixing KiCad/Altium slowed
                merges.
              </li>
              <li>
                Subsystems worked alone but integration time was the real
                schedule driver.
              </li>
              <li>
                HTTP pull loop was simpler to debug than ESP-NOW for two-node
                comms.
              </li>
              <li>
                WS2812 feedback on both boards was the fastest way to see
                air-quality states.
              </li>
              <li>
                Always budget PSRAM and frame buffers early when planning MJPEG
                streaming.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pin planning needs to happen before routing—RF + camera lanes
                compete fast.
              </li>
              <li>
                Calibration for MQ-2 matters more than wiring; we locked in Ro
                before demos.
              </li>
              <li>
                Power budget reviews caught headroom gaps before we heated
                traces.
              </li>
              <li>
                Poster/storytelling benefits from early asset collection; it
                avoids last-minute design crunch.
              </li>
              <li>
                Documenting endpoints and message formats prevented “mystery
                500s” on the HMI.

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-ink/80 space-y-1">
              <li>
                Pick one ECAD stack early and stick with it; enforce common
                footprints.
              </li>
              <li>
                Write a tiny loopback server to simulate the rover so your HMI
                can be developed offline.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lock down pin maps and regulators before any schematic review.
              </li>
              <li>
                Automate flashing + basic self-tests so every merge proves
                hardware still responds.
              </li>
              <li>
                Keep a single source of truth for endpoints and message shapes;
                update it when you change code.
