              Why TerraGuard exists
            </h2>
          </div>
          <p class="text-ink/80">
            Wildfires are becoming more common and more severe, and one of the
            biggest challenges for responders is catching early hot spots before
            they grow into large fires. Many of these early warning signs happen
            in remote areas where people aren’t always able to check in person.
            Our project focuses on solving this problem by creating TerraGuard,
            an autonomous rover that can patrol an area and collect real-time
            environmental data that may point to potential wildfire activity.
            The main purpose of the system is to help detect changes in
            temperature, smoke, air quality, and other conditions so responders
            can react faster and more safely.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink/80">
            The target users for this system are firefighters, fire-watch teams,
            and emergency response groups who need reliable information from the
            field without having to physically be in dangerous areas. We also
            considered secondary users like researchers and community partners
            who could use the data for studying fire behavior or improving
            prevention strategies. These users need technology that is easy to
            understand, simple to operate, and durable enough for outdoor
            environments.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink/80">
            The scope of our project includes designing and prototyping a
            complete embedded system using sensors, a microcontroller, wireless
            communication, and a mobile rover platform. TerraGuard uses HTTPS to
            send and receive data to and from the base station, where alerts can
            be viewed in real time. If the rover detects something past a safe
            threshold, it triggers LEDs and a speaker to warn responders.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink/80">
            Our prototype includes multiple environmental sensors, a GPS module,
            and a camera mounted on a mobile rover. The system reads data,
            checks it against preset safety limits, and communicates the
            information through a mesh network. Each team member received $60
            toward the project, giving us a total budget of $360 to build and
            test the rover.

                Phoenix Force commits to building a reliable and realistic
                wildfire-detection prototype that can identify early warning
                signs, communicate without public Wi‑Fi, and present clear
                alerts through a simple, glove-friendly interface. Our team aims
                to meet measurable engineering goals such as low-latency alerts,
                accurate sensor performance, and consistent communication
                reliability. We agree to document our decisions, justify our

          <p class="text-ink/80">
            At the start of the project, our team brainstormed over a hundred
            different ideas. We eventually narrowed them down to a top fifteen
            list that included things like a thermal-camera drone, smoke
            sensors, LoRa mesh communication, rugged weather stations,
            swappable-battery systems, and even a hybrid firefighting drone.
            While going through these ideas, we noticed that many of them
            pointed toward the same need, which was early wildfire detection
            with good mobility and reliable communication. Instead of choosing a
            fully stationary weather station or going with an expensive UAV
            platform, our team decided to combine the idea of a mobile sensing
            unit with a simple HMI. We felt this gave us a unique direction
            while still being realistic for our skill level and budget. We also
            chose a rover instead of a drone because drones are much more
            difficult to operate, cost more to maintain, and have very short
            battery life. A rover can carry more sensors, run longer, and avoid
            flight restrictions, which made it the better choice for us.
            Instructor feedback also played a big role in shaping our concept.
            We were asked to put our concept generation directly on the website
            instead of only submitting a document. The suggestion to use pop-ups
            or tabs pushed us to make the site more interactive. We were also
            told to cite any AI-generated images and to add callouts to our
            product sketch so viewers could easily tell what each subsystem was.
            This helped us clean up our presentation and make our design
            clearer. The biggest pivot we made was shifting from drone-based
            sensing to a ground-based rover that collects temperature,
            heat-pattern, air-quality, humidity, and pressure data. Once we
            decided on this approach, we focused on adding mesh-network
            communication and a separate screen module for displaying alerts.
            This final concept fit the course requirements, stayed within our
            budget, and gave us something original that was not copied from
            online projects.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink/80">
            Two units work together: the Rover (ESP32‑CAM) and the Commander
            Screen (CrowPanel ESP32‑S3). The rover reads BME688, MQ-2, GPS,
            ultrasonic, MPU6050, drives motors via L298N, and hosts an AP. The
            screen joins that AP, polls for metrics, and shows MJPEG video via
            an LVGL interface with audio/LED alerts. Commands flow back over
            HTTP; safety checks stop motion when obstacles or high gas levels
            appear. Everything remains closed-loop on the rover’s AP for field
            reliability.

            Communication sequence: the rover hosts the AP and serves MJPEG +
            telemetry endpoints. The commander polls those endpoints, and drive
            commands return over HTTP to the rover. LEDs and audio on both units
            mirror warnings (gas thresholds, obstacles, visibility) while
            staying entirely on the rover’s network for field reliability.

            Full schematic plus routed board and renders. ESP32-S3-U1 is the
            main processor on the rover PCB, hosting the AP and handling camera,
            sensing, and drive control. Power steps from the 7.4–7.8 V pack
            through L7805CV to 5 V and then LM3940 to 3.3 V for logic/sensors.
            Pin headers break out camera, GPS, MQ-2, BME688, LEDs, and motor
            lines so off-board components can mount away from the PCB while
            staying within the 100×100 mm target.

            Custom rover CAD inspired by NASA Mars rovers, with a rocker-bogie

            uses generous ground clearance plus mounting bosses for the PCB and
            off-board sensors.

                <li>One ECAD stack only—KiCad vs Altium slowed merges.</li>
                <li>Integration time dominates once subsystems work.</li>
                <li>HTTP polling was simpler to debug than ESP-NOW.</li>
                <li>WS2812 feedback made air-quality states obvious.</li>
                <li>Budget PSRAM/frame buffers early for MJPEG.</li>
                <li>Pin planning first—RF and camera lanes conflict fast.</li>
                <li>MQ-2 calibration (Ro) mattered more than wiring.</li>
                <li>Power budget reviews saved traces from overheating.</li>
                <li>Collect assets early to avoid poster crunch.</li>
                <li>Document endpoints to prevent “mystery 500s.”</li>
